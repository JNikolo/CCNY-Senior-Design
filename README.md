### RAG Playground
This project aims for hands-on exploration of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model architecture. This interactive platform provides users with a user-friendly interface to experiment with RAG in real-time, allowing for parameter customization, query visualization, and multi-modal input support.
